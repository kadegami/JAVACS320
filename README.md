## Project One: Contact Service

### Files
- Contact.java
- ContactService.java
- ContactTest.java
- ContactServiceTest.java

### Reflection

In Project One, I focused on developing the contact service for a mobile application. The unit testing approach involved meticulous testing of the Contact and ContactService classes. I ensured that each test case aligned with the software requirements, covering scenarios such as unique contact IDs and field constraints. The experience of writing JUnit tests enhanced my understanding of software requirements and the importance of comprehensive testing.

### Reflection

Project Two involved summarizing and reflecting on the unit testing approach employed in Project One. The report highlighted the alignment of testing strategies with software requirements, emphasizing the overall quality of JUnit tests. Writing the report provided insights into my experience and the importance of technical soundness and efficiency in code. This reflection deepened my understanding of software testing techniques and the mindset required for effective testing.

## General Reflection

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring functional and secure code involves a multi-faceted approach. Rigorous testing, both unit and integration, is essential to identify and rectify issues promptly. Adhering to secure coding practices, such as input validation and secure data handling, adds an extra layer of protection. Regularly updating dependencies and staying informed about security best practices further contributes to software security.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs is a crucial aspect of software development. Effective communication with stakeholders, including end-users, is paramount. Conducting thorough requirements analysis, gathering user feedback, and iterative development based on user testing help ensure that the program aligns with user expectations. User-centric design principles, such as usability testing, play a vital role in incorporating user needs into the program.

### How do I approach designing software?

Approaching software design involves a systematic and iterative process. Understanding the problem domain, defining clear requirements, and breaking down the problem into manageable components are key initial steps. Employing design patterns, modularization, and following coding best practices contribute to a robust and maintainable software design. Regularly reviewing and refining the design based on feedback and changing requirements ensures adaptability and scalability.
